                <p>One of the oldest civilisations in the world, India is a mosaic of multicultural experiences. With a rich heritage and myriad attractions, the country is among the most popular tourist destinations in the world. It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity</p>

                <p>India is blessed with heritage riches and a regal lineage. Vestiges of Indian royalty can be felt in the various forts and palaces speckled across the country. From hill forts in Rajasthan to formidable fortifications in Gwalior, Golconda and Delhi, the history of India stands tall and proud, housed inside these marvellous structures. To experience how the royalty lived in the past, several of these palace-turned heritage hotels are a must-visit.</p>
